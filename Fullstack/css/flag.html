            Hi my name is Raghava Sammeta. I am aspiring to crack MAANG companies expecially Google SWE-I. 
            So currently i am preparing DSA and webdevelopment.OK fine,
             I switch to code view, and edit the HTML to add the class to the img tag without WP's assistance. That causes WP to freak out because the user added a class (never mind that it's added in a perfectly valid manner, right next to WP's own image class).
